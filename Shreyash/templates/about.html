            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
              I’m a Computer Science engineering student with a strong interest in
              backend development and web technologies. I enjoy building structured,
              efficient, and scalable web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              My primary focus is on Python-based backend development using Flask.
              I believe in learning by building real-world projects and continuously
              improving my technical skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m motivated, consistent, and always open to learning new technologies.
              My goal is to grow as a backend developer and contribute to meaningful
              projects while continuously improving my skills.
            </p>
